"""
A primitive root modulo p is an integer g that generates all the numbers in the range of 1 to p-1 when raised to
different powers modulo p. In other words, for any number n between 1 and p-1, there exists a unique positive
integer r such that n = g^r (mod p).

A sequence (gr mod p) always repeats after some value of r, since mod p produces a finite number of values.
If g is a primitive root modulo p and p is prime, then the period of repetition is pâˆ’1. The last non-repeating digit
will always be 1. If 1 is first encountered before or after p-1 then it is not a primitive root.
